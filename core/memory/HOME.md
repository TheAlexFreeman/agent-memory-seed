# Home

This is the Home file for the memory store. After `core/INIT.md` routes you here, use it to load session context and check what's top-of-mind.

## Context loading order

Load in this order. Skip files marked _(skip if placeholder)_ when they contain only default text.

1. `core/memory/users/SUMMARY.md` — user portrait and working style
2. `core/memory/activity/SUMMARY.md` _(skip if placeholder)_ — recent session continuity
3. `core/memory/working/scratchpad/USER.md` _(skip if placeholder)_ — user-authored current priorities
4. `core/memory/working/scratchpad/CURRENT.md` _(skip if placeholder)_ — agent working notes

Then load task-driven drill-downs only when the current task makes them relevant:

- `core/memory/working/projects/SUMMARY.md` — active projects and plans
- `core/memory/knowledge/SUMMARY.md` — accumulated knowledge index
- `core/memory/skills/SUMMARY.md` — codified procedures

### Maintenance probes (before loading extra files)

- Count non-empty lines in `ACCESS.jsonl` files — if any hit the aggregation trigger (see `core/INIT.md`), note for end-of-session.
- Check `core/governance/review-queue.md` — load only when it has real entries or the user asks.

### Access-tracked namespaces

`core/memory/users/`, `core/memory/knowledge/`, `core/memory/skills/`, `core/memory/activity/`, `core/memory/working/projects/`.

Log retrievals from these folders to their `ACCESS.jsonl`. See `README.md` § "Memory curation" for the format. `core/governance/` is not access-tracked.

### Worktree mode

In worktree mode, use `host_repo_root` from `agent-bootstrap.toml` for host-code git operations; use the worktree path for memory files.

## Top of mind

Protocol design (active):
- Activity logging for automations and user interactions
- User/automation tracking for per-session best-guess
- Activity log consolidation/archival, eventual summarization into narrative
- Which aspects of the system most engage the user, and why?
