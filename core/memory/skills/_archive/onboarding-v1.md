# Onboarding Fallback: Interview-Style First-Session Discovery

This is the archived pre-redesign onboarding flow. It is not the default first-session experience. Use it only when an explicit fallback is needed, such as a constrained platform or a user request for a more structured questionnaire-style intake.

## When to use this fallback

Activate this fallback only when the default collaborative onboarding in `core/memory/skills/onboarding.md` is unsuitable, AND the session is still a true first session: no date-organized chat folders exist in `core/memory/activity/`, and either `core/memory/users/SUMMARY.md` contains "No portrait yet" or `core/memory/users/` contains a file with `source: template` in its frontmatter.

Before using this fallback, the agent should already have been routed from `core/INIT.md`, reviewed the relevant change-control and read-only sections of `core/governance/update-guidelines.md`, and checked write access per `core/governance/first-run.md`.

## Steps

### 0. Check for a starter profile template

If `core/memory/users/` contains a file with `source: template` in its YAML frontmatter (placed there by `setup.sh --profile`), the user chose a starter profile during setup. In this case:

1. Read the template file.
2. Present the pre-filled traits to the user: "I see you started with the [role] template. Let me walk through these to see what fits."
3. For each trait marked `[template]`, ask whether it's accurate, needs adjustment, or should be removed.
4. Fill in any blank fields through conversation.
5. Rewrite the profile: retag confirmed traits from `[template]` to `[observed]`, drop traits the user rejected, and incorporate any new traits discovered. Update the file's YAML frontmatter from `source: template` to `source: user-stated` and `trust: high`, and set `last_verified` to today's date.
6. Skip to step 5 (open-ended capture) after confirming all template traits — steps 2–4 below are for blank-slate onboarding.

If no template exists, proceed with step 1 as normal.

### 1. Introduce the memory system

Briefly explain to the user:

- You have persistent memory stored in this repository.
- What you learn in this conversation will be available in future sessions, even across different models.
- You'd like to ask a few questions to build an initial profile so future interactions start strong.

Keep it concise — one short paragraph, not a lecture.

### 2. Discover the user's role and context

Cover:

- **Role and responsibilities.** What they do, what domain they work in.
- **Key projects.** What they're actively working on or will be working on with AI assistance.
- **Domain expertise.** What they know well (so you can calibrate depth) and what's new to them.

### 3. Discover communication preferences

Cover:

- **Detail level.** Do they prefer concise answers or thorough explanations?
- **Tone.** Casual, professional, direct, exploratory?
- **Format preferences.** Do they like bullet points, prose, code-first, examples-first?
- **Anti-preferences.** Anything they find annoying or unhelpful in AI interactions.

### 4. Discover tools and environment

Cover:

- **Primary languages and frameworks** they work with.
- **Editor/IDE** they use.
- **Platforms and services** that come up regularly (cloud providers, CI/CD, etc.).
- **Collaboration context.** Solo work, team, open source?

**Pacing note for steps 2–4:** These categories guide what to cover, not the order of questions. Weave them naturally across 3–5 conversational turns rather than exhausting one category before starting the next.

### 5. Open-ended capture

Ask: _"Is there anything else you'd like me to remember going forward? Anything that would make our interactions more useful?"_

This catches important context that structured questions miss. Don't skip it.

### 6. Propose and write the initial profile

Based on the conversation:

1. Draft one or more proposed files in `core/memory/users/` capturing the discovered traits. Use the frontmatter schema:
   ```yaml
   ---
   source: user-stated
   origin_session: core/memory/activity/YYYY/MM/DD/chat-001
   created: YYYY-MM-DD
   last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD
   trust: high
   ---
   ```
2. Tag each trait with `[observed]` confidence when the user stated it directly.
3. Present the proposed portrait to the user and state that saving to `core/memory/users/` is a proposed-tier change that requires explicit confirmation.
4. If the user requests edits, revise the proposal and ask for confirmation again.
5. Only after explicit in-chat confirmation may you create the `core/memory/users/` files and update `core/memory/users/SUMMARY.md`.
6. That explicit confirmation counts as the required approval for the first user-profile file creation during onboarding.
7. If write access is unavailable, do not attempt the write. Instead, produce the confirmed profile using the onboarding export format from `HUMANS/tooling/onboard-export-template.md`.
8. If the session ends without confirmation, do not write to `core/memory/users/`.

### 7. Record the session

Log this conversation following the standard chat archival structure:

- Create the appropriate `core/memory/activity/YYYY/MM/DD/chat-001/` folder.
- Write `transcript.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, and `reflection.md`.
- Append access notes to the relevant ACCESS.jsonl files for any content files you read. Include `session_id` whenever the chat folder is known.
- If read-only, keep chat archival in the onboarding export produced in step 6.

## Quality criteria

- The initial portrait should capture **5–10 durable traits**, all tagged `[observed]`.
- The user should feel accurately represented — not a caricature or a list of demographics, but a useful working portrait.
- Communication preferences should be specific enough to measurably change agent behavior in the next session.
- No trait should be invented or inferred beyond what the user actually said. If something is ambiguous, note it as `[tentative]` rather than guessing.
- No `core/memory/users/` write should occur before explicit user confirmation.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't interrogate.** This should feel like a conversation, not a form.
- **Don't over-collect.** 5–10 solid traits are better than 25 shallow ones.
- **Don't promise too much.** The memory system improves with use — don't set expectations for perfect recall from session one.
- **Don't write memory optimistically.** Proposal first, confirmation second, write third.
