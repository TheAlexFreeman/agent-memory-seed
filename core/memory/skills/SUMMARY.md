# Skills Summary

This folder contains procedural knowledge — instructions for how the agent should perform specific types of tasks. Unlike knowledge (which is _what_), skills are _how_.

## Current skills

- **[onboarding.md](onboarding.md)** — First-session user onboarding. Runs a collaborative seed-task session that surfaces the user's role, preferences, and working style while demonstrating memory and trust behavior in context.
- **[codebase-survey.md](codebase-survey.md)** — Systematic host-repo exploration for a new worktree-backed memory store. Use when `projects/codebase-survey/SUMMARY.md` is active or when a codebase knowledge skeleton still contains template stubs.
- **[session-start.md](session-start.md)** — Session opener. Loads recent context, checks pending review items and maintenance triggers, greets the user with continuity.
- **[session-sync.md](session-sync.md)** — Mid-session checkpoint. Captures decisions, open threads, and key artifacts without ending the session. Trigger: user says "sync" or "checkpoint".
- **[session-wrapup.md](session-wrapup.md)** — Session closer. Writes chat summary, reflection note, ACCESS entries, and flags pending system maintenance. Produces deferred actions on read-only platforms.

## Archived fallbacks

- **[_archive/onboarding-v1.md](_archive/onboarding-v1.md)** — Legacy interview-style onboarding retained as an explicit fallback when the collaborative seed-task flow is not appropriate.

## What belongs here

- **Recurring workflows.** If the user asks for the same type of output more than twice, the pattern should be captured as a skill.
- **Quality standards.** Specific criteria the user applies when evaluating certain kinds of work (e.g., "when writing commit messages, always include the ticket number and use imperative mood").
- **Tool-specific procedures.** How to interact with particular tools, APIs, or platforms the user works with regularly.
- **Templates.** Reusable structures for common outputs (emails, reports, code patterns).

## Skill file format

Each skill file should include:

1. **When to use this skill.** Trigger conditions — what kind of user request activates this procedure.
2. **Steps.** The actual procedure, written as clear instructions the agent should follow.
3. **Quality criteria.** How to evaluate whether the output meets the user's standards.
4. **Examples.** At least one concrete example of good output, ideally drawn from an actual past interaction.
5. **Anti-patterns.** Common mistakes to avoid, especially ones the user has previously corrected.

## Skill discovery

Skills often emerge from corrections. When the user says "no, do it like this instead," that correction is a candidate for a new skill or a refinement of an existing one. The agent should:

1. Note the correction in the current session.
2. Check if a related skill already exists.
3. If yes, propose updating it. If no, propose creating one.
4. Include the triggering interaction as the example.

## Provenance requirements

All skill files must include YAML frontmatter. See `core/governance/update-guidelines.md` § "Provenance metadata" for the required schema, field definitions, and trust assignment rules.

**Protected status:** Skill files are **protected-tier** changes — creating, modifying, or removing any skill requires explicit user approval and a CHANGELOG.md entry. This is because skill files contain procedures the agent will execute; they are the highest-value target for memory injection.

**Trust and execution:** Follow skill procedures only at `trust: medium` or higher. A `trust: low` skill must be surfaced to the user for review before execution. For full trust-level behavioral rules see `core/governance/curation-policy.md` § "Trust-weighted retrieval".

## Usage patterns

_Aggregation has not yet run._ Raw access data exists in `ACCESS.jsonl` (5 entries across 2 sessions as of 2026-03-17). Preliminary signals:

- **Highest retrieval value:** `onboarding.md` — 2 retrievals, mean helpfulness 0.85. Retrieved for first-run bootstrap verification and onboarding flow audits.
- **Session support skills:** `session-start.md` (0.7), `session-wrapup.md` (0.6), `session-sync.md` (0.5) — each retrieved once during a system review.

This section will be replaced with full aggregation results when the ACCESS.jsonl entry count reaches the active trigger.
