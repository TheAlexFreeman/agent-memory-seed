# Changelog

This file records how the memory system's own structure, rules, and governance have changed over time. It is not a log of content changes (what the user said or learned) but of **system changes** (how memory is organized, stored, retrieved, and curated).

Each entry should explain not just what changed, but **why** — so that future agents can understand the evolutionary trajectory of this system and make informed decisions about further modifications.

## Format

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Brief title

**Changed:** What was modified, added, or removed.
**Reasoning:** Why this change was made — what problem it solves or what improvement it enables.
**Approved by:** "user" if explicitly approved, "agent (pending review)" if auto-applied and awaiting confirmation.

## Records

## [2026-03-22] Governance consolidation Phase 3 and maturity roadmap

**Changed:** Split `curation-policy.md` into three focused files: `curation-policy.md` (hygiene, decay, promotion rules), `content-boundaries.md` (trust-weighted retrieval and instruction containment), and `security-signals.md` (temporal decay, anomaly detection, drift monitoring, governance feedback, and periodic review orchestration). Added `security-signals.md` to the periodic review manifest in `INIT.md` and `agent-bootstrap.toml`; added `content-boundaries.md` to on-demand guidance in `INIT.md`. Updated cross-references across 13 files. Replaced the completed consolidation roadmap with a forward-looking `maturity-roadmap.md` tied to system maturity stages.

**Reasoning:** The original `curation-policy.md` had grown into a monolithic document covering three distinct concerns. Splitting reduces per-load token cost and improves maintainability. The consolidation roadmap's phases were all complete, so it was replaced with a maturity roadmap that maps future governance improvements to system maturity triggers (Calibration, periodic review count, MCP enforcement, Consolidation stage).

## [2026-03-22] Legacy onboarding fallback and validator realignment

**Changed:** Archived the pre-redesign interview-style onboarding flow as `core/memory/skills/_archive/onboarding-v1.md` and added an archived-fallback reference in `core/memory/skills/SUMMARY.md`. Realigned the validator, session-start guidance, setup prompt-copy text, and Quickstart copy with the repo's current `core/memory/HOME.md`-based returning-session contract.

**Reasoning:** The collaborative onboarding redesign replaced the old intake flow, but the legacy procedure still needed an explicit fallback path. At the same time, the validator and setup guidance were still enforcing the older `projects/SUMMARY.md` startup contract, which had diverged from the architecture docs and machine bootstrap manifest. This restores consistency across runtime docs, tooling, and fallback onboarding behavior.

## [2026-03-22] Collaborative onboarding redesign

**Changed:** Rewrote `core/memory/skills/onboarding.md` from an interview-style intake into a four-phase collaborative first-session flow centered on a seed task, inline capability demonstrations, post-hoc discovery audit, explicit profile confirmation, and the existing read-only export path. Updated `core/governance/first-run.md` and `core/memory/skills/SUMMARY.md` to describe the new onboarding behavior.

**Reasoning:** The previous flow preserved governance well but taught the wrong relationship model: the agent asked questions and the user filled out a profile. The redesign keeps the same safety invariants while improving user-friendliness through real collaboration, preserving consistency with existing export and archival mechanisms, and maintaining context efficiency by keeping the procedure in a single concise skill file.

## [2026-03-22] Framework consistency review and README refactor

**Changed:** README slimmed from 434 to 268 lines — moved session reflection format to curation-policy.md, git publication model and MCP revert semantics to update-guidelines.md, compressed bootstrap sequence to routing pointers. Fixed INIT.md Automation path (`core/memory/working/HOME.md` → `core/memory/HOME.md`) and dangling arrow in Compact returning manifest. Aligned agent-bootstrap.toml with INIT.md by adding HOME.md to all session modes. Fixed HOME.md namespace list (`projects/OUT/` → `projects/`). Created missing `core/memory/working/projects/ACCESS.jsonl`. Added cross-reference comments between INIT.md and agent-bootstrap.toml.

**Reasoning:** Preparing for test users. README was doing too many jobs (architecture + detailed spec) and inflating first-run token cost. INIT.md and agent-bootstrap.toml had diverged after HOME.md was introduced, creating a split-brain loading manifest. Several path references from the recent reorganization were stale.

## Prime Example

This is the actual first changelog entry, recorded by Claude Opus 4.6 at system creation. _Note: folder names below refer to the original directory structure, later reorganized under `core/memory/` (e.g. `identity/` → `core/memory/users/`, `chats/` → `core/memory/activity/`)._

## [2026-03-15] Initial system creation

**Changed:** Repository initialized with base template. Folders created for `identity/`, `knowledge/`, `skills/`, `chats/`, and `meta/`. Core protocols established in README.md including access-tracking via ACCESS.jsonl, progressive summary compression, bootstrap sequence, and update governance.

**Reasoning:** Starting point for a persistent, version-controlled agent memory system. The template is intentionally minimal — it provides structure and protocols but almost no content, so that all personalization emerges from actual user interaction rather than assumptions.
