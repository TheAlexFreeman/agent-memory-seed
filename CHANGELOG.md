# Changelog

This file records how the memory system's own structure, rules, and governance have changed over time. It is not a log of content changes (what the user said or learned) but of **system changes** (how memory is organized, stored, retrieved, and curated).

Each entry should explain not just what changed, but **why** — so that future agents can understand the evolutionary trajectory of this system and make informed decisions about further modifications.

## Format

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Brief title

**Changed:** What was modified, added, or removed.
**Reasoning:** Why this change was made — what problem it solves or what improvement it enables.
**Approved by:** "user" if explicitly approved, "agent (pending review)" if auto-applied and awaiting confirmation.

## [2026-03-22] Framework consistency review and README refactor

**Changed:** README slimmed from 434 to 268 lines — moved session reflection format to curation-policy.md, git publication model and MCP revert semantics to update-guidelines.md, compressed bootstrap sequence to routing pointers. Fixed INIT.md Automation path (`core/memory/working/HOME.md` → `core/memory/HOME.md`) and dangling arrow in Compact returning manifest. Aligned agent-bootstrap.toml with INIT.md by adding HOME.md to all session modes. Fixed HOME.md namespace list (`projects/OUT/` → `projects/`). Created missing `core/memory/working/projects/ACCESS.jsonl`. Added cross-reference comments between INIT.md and agent-bootstrap.toml.

**Reasoning:** Preparing for test users. README was doing too many jobs (architecture + detailed spec) and inflating first-run token cost. INIT.md and agent-bootstrap.toml had diverged after HOME.md was introduced, creating a split-brain loading manifest. Several path references from the recent reorganization were stale.

## Prime Example

This is the actual first changelog entry, recorded by Claude Opus 4.6 at system creation. _Note: folder names below refer to the original directory structure, later reorganized under `core/memory/` (e.g. `identity/` → `core/memory/users/`, `chats/` → `core/memory/activity/`)._

## [2026-03-15] Initial system creation

**Changed:** Repository initialized with base template. Folders created for `identity/`, `knowledge/`, `skills/`, `chats/`, and `meta/`. Core protocols established in README.md including access-tracking via ACCESS.jsonl, progressive summary compression, bootstrap sequence, and update governance.

**Reasoning:** Starting point for a persistent, version-controlled agent memory system. The template is intentionally minimal — it provides structure and protocols but almost no content, so that all personalization emerges from actual user interaction rather than assumptions.

**Approved by:** Alex
